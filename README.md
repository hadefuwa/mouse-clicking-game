- **Game Over**: If accuracy drops below 30% (after at least 5 clicks), the game ends with an option to try again

## Accuracy Tracking

The game tracks both successful clicks and misclicks:
- Successful clicks increase the score and streak
- Misclicks (clicking anywhere except the target) are counted separately and reset the streak
- Accuracy percentage is calculated and displayed
- Accuracy display changes color based on performance:
  - Green: 80-100% accuracy
  - Orange: 60-79% accuracy
  - Red: Below 60% accuracy

This feature helps monitor your child's improvement over time and provides visual feedback on their coordination progress.
